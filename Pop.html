        Pop music is the one genre that doesn't really have its own style, much like American culture.  It is a blend
        of many other styles.  It got its start in the mid-1900's as a softer form of rock and roll.  It has also borrowed
        from jazz and country, and more recently from electronic dance music.  Pop music is essentially what will be popular
        to the majority of the population.  The songs are just the right length with predictable structure, have catchy tunes
        and lyrics, and are not too slow but also not in your face loud.  The successful pop stars also have visual appear and
        great concerts.  Large record companies drive this phenomneon along as they rapidly dish out new pop songs all the time,
        and get their artists spots on the radio, TV, CD's, and now our phones and the internet.
