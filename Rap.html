    Rapping is more of a speaking of words than singing, although it is usually done with music and holds to a beat.
    Rap exists within the genre technically known as hip hop, although both terms will be used.  This type of music
    began relatively recently in the 1970's.  It was started by Caribbean groups living in the Bronx, and quickly spread
    to other urban areas that introduced slightly new styles.  The beats are electronically made and any technique for
    turning what musical tools we have into interesiting sounds is used.  The content of the songs reflects the culture
    and life lived by the communities the artists come from.
